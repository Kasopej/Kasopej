# Hello! 👋

I am Kasope Johnson. A senior frontend software _engineer_. I have deep knowledge of Javascript concepts (closures, OOP, super, higher order functions, this/context resolution, event loop/asynchronous programming, promises) & common Web APIs (Fetch, Storage, Location), backend for frontend mechanisms (caching, secure cookies etc) & web security (XSS, CSRF mitigations etc). I am very comfortable with React, NextJs and Vue
### 😄 Pronouns
He/Him


### 🌱 My stack

- TypeScript – designing maintainable, strongly typed component systems and enforcing type-safe data flows across complex frontends.
- Web Security – implementing practical defenses against XSS, CSRF, Clickjacking, and related vulnerabilities through content policies, secure cookie management, and input sanitization.
- Performance Optimization – improving load times with Next.js caching, React memoization, lazy loading, and bundler-level optimizations.
- Styling & UI Systems – building elegant, accessible UIs with ShadCN/UI, Radix UI, and utility-first styling approaches (Tailwind).

#### Framework specific
- React & Next.js – building dynamic, SSR/SSG-driven applications with modern features like Server Components, Suspense, and streaming.
- State Management – deep experience with Redux Toolkit and RTK Query for structured state handling, data caching, and API integration.
- For testing, I use React Testing Library (and Jest/Vitest depending on the project).
- I use both Vue3 & Vue 2 extensively. I am very comfortable with both Options & Composition API. Tip: Did you know it's possible to mix & get advantages of both approaches in a single component? Just use 2 script in your.vue file! Doesn't work if you are using script "setup" compile flag as that uses a different compilation flow, you have to use normal scripts without setup (TS/JS)).
- I use Vue Testing Utils with a bit of Testing-Library/Vue for testing. VTU allows me to do better state mocking while Testing-Library/Vue helps with testing user interactions in a cleaner approach. P.S: Testing-Library uses render function is a modified VTU mount function but it outputs helper functions for better testing!
- I use Bootstrap-Vue & Vuetify for utility components. While I use chartjs for data visualizations.
- I love configuring modern application workflows with bundlers. I use Webpack and Vue-CLI (which is a Vue-flavored extension of Webpack). With these tools, I have been able to successfully upgrade a Vue 2 application to Vue 3. The @vue/compat package was a great help too!

- I have experience building CI pipelines (with GitHub actions).
