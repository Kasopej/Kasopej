# Hello! 👋

I am _Kasope Johnson_. I am a frontend software _engineer_. I have high deep knowledge of Javascript concepts (closures, OOP, super, higher order functions, this/context resolution, event loop/asynchronous programming, promises) & common Web APIs (Fetch, Storage, Location). I build professionally with JS frontend frameworks i.e Vue & React (I have a soft spot for Vue!).

### 😄 Pronouns
He/Him

### 🌱 Positions Held (Past & Current)

- 2xMentor at VueJs Forge (Largest Vuejs community event)
- Frontend Software Engineer @ [Smartflow Technologies Ltd](https://github.com/smartflowtech-ssbu/) 
- Led a DevCenter Community developer group

### 🌱 A bit more about my work

- I use both Vue3 & Vue 2 extensively. I am very comfortable with both Options & Composition API. Tip: Did you know it's possible to mix & get advantages of both approaches in a single component? Just use 2 script in your.vue file! Doesn't work if you are using script "setup" compile flag as that uses a different compilation flow, you have to use normal scripts without setup (TS/JS)).
- I also build with Nuxt [Link to repo](https://github.com/Kasopej/Nuxt-Ecommerce)
- I use Vue Testing Utils with a bit of Testing-Library/Vue for testing. VTU allows me to do better state mocking while Testing-Library/Vue helps with testing user interactions in a cleaner approach. P.S: Testing-Library uses render function is a modified VTU mount function but it outputs helper functions for better testing!
- I use Bootstrap-Vue & Vuetify for utility components. While I use chartjs for data visualizations.
- I love configuring modern application workflows with bundlers. I use Webpack and Vue-CLI (which is a Vue-flavored extension of Webpack). With these tools, I have been able to successfully upgrade a Vue 2 application to Vue 3. The @vue/compat package was a great help too!

- I have experience building CI pipelines (with GitHub actions). I was able to optimize this process for my current company, helping them reduce app build by 60%. I also reduced costs by configuring triggers to run specific workflow scripts on (company) required Github repository events.
